    <h1> Breathing Exercises </h1>

    <p> Breathing exercises are... </p>
    <p> We're going to be using the box method, which consists of four steps: </p>
    <p> </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Breathe in slowly for four seconds. </li>
      <li> Hold for four seconds. </li>
      <li> Breathe out slowly for four seconds. </li>
      <li> Rest and repeat. </li>
    </ol>

    <p> The four different steps of the method are just like the four different sides of a box! </p>
    <p> This technique is best used during those moments when you feel like you canâ€™t breathe,
      but can also be used on a normal basis just to clear your head or bring you back to focus. </p>

    <p> Click the 'Run' below to start the timed exercise. </p>
